### Windows Compatibility
For Windows builds, the BLE package needs to be changed to `flutter_blue_plus_windows`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Scanning & Connecting to BLE Devices

1. Enter the **Target Device Name** in the text field.
2. Click **Scan** to start discovering BLE devices.
3. If a matching device is found, it **automatically connects**.
4. Once connected, the button changes to **Disconnect**.
5. Click **Disconnect** to disconnect and allow new scans.

### Capturing & Sending Images Over BLE

1. Click **Capture Region** to take a screenshot.
2. The image is resized to **126x126 pixels**.
3. The processed image is converted to **RGB565** format.
4. The app sends the image data over BLE.

### Theme Toggle

- Click the **Theme Button** in the top-left to switch between **Light** and **Dark Mode**.
- The selected theme is **saved** using `shared_preferences`.

### System Tray

- The app runs in the **system tray** when minimized.
- Click the tray icon to restore the window.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### BLE Connection Issues on macOS

- macOS may **not display some BLE services** due to permission restrictions.
- Ensure `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` is set in `Info.plist`:
  ```xml
  <key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
  <string>App requires Bluetooth access</string>
  ```
- Restart **Bluetooth** and **reconnect the device**.

### Image Processing Errors

- Ensure the image is correctly captured before processing.
- If the app crashes, check that the image file path is valid.
